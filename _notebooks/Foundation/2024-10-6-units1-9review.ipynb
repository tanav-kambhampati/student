    "# Overall Summary: \n",
    "These team teaches were extremely useful because they contain the fundamentals of Java. These are literally the most important parts of Java because without them, you can't really understand anything else. Although the loops and conditionals are very simple, I'm glad we dived into OOP and classes, it seems very fun. I still have a few doubts on constructors and mutators, but I will work to resolve them soon. \n",
